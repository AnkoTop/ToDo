# ToDo

Simple ToDo app made with TDD (incomplete implementation - see below)


##Description

In the end this app won't be finished. The goal of the Packt publishing book **Test-Driven Development with Swift** by _Dominik Hauser_ is to learn TDD by making a simple ToDo app (this one). After a good start (and learning the very basics of TDD) the book ends up with a partial working app which you should finish yourself. 

Decided not to bother (who needs another To-Do app?) as this has no added value.

When you want to learn TDD forget this book and find something on Youtube to get a general idea about TDD (there are some really nice videos out there) and to learn the specifics of XCode Unit testing and/or User Interface testing just search for documentation/articles on the internet. You will learn more by doing this then by using this book as a guide.
